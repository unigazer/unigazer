<p>Hi! I'm a big fan of open-source software and hardware so I'll try to contribute as much as can. The GitHub community has helped me improve my coding so I think it's time that I give my contribution to the GitHub community. I believe that working with open-source software and hardware can help humanity achieve extraordinary accomplishment if we all share findings and knowledge freely. <span>🌎 🌍 🌏</span></p>
