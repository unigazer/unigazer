## Hi!
<p>I'm a big fan of open-source software, hardware and the Universe, so I'll try my best to contribute as much as I can. The GitHub community has helped me improve my coding so I think it's time that I give my contribution to the GitHub community back. I believe that working with open-source software and hardware can help humanity achieve extraordinary accomplishments if we all share findings and knowledge freely among ourselves. <span>🌎 🌍 🌏</span></p>
